            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Saraf Mohaimen Chowdhury, an early-career researcher passionate about quantum materials and nanoscale phenomena. My research aims to understand the physical properties of nanomaterials using first-principles calculations, and explore how tiny structures from atomically thin layers to quantum dots—can lead to new possibilities in electronics, photonics, and information technologies. I’m particularly fascinated by how spins, light, and topology interact at the smallest scales, and how we can harness these effects for future technologies.         </section>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy how studying the tiny fragments of the universe can expose the deeper workings of nature. My research focuses on the properties and applications of low-dimensional quantum materials. I am particularly interested in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-dimensional materials (2D monolayers, quantum dots, TM-based compounds)</li>
                <li>Density Functional Theory (DFT) and various computational physics</li>
                <li>Doping, defects, and surface effects semiconductor nanoflakes</li>
                <li>Topological behavior of materials</li> 
                <li>Spin-resolved quantum transport and spintronic device modeling</li>
                <li>Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Academic Books That Influenced Me</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Molecular Quantum Mechanics</em> – Atkins & Friedman
                    <br><small>This text helped me build a foundational understanding of atomic-level interactions, their interpretations, and the conceptual basis of various approximation theories.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Semiconductor Physics and Devices</em> – Donald A. Neamen
                    <br><small>Became familiar during my undergraduate studies, this text drew me toward crystallography, nonequilibrium behaviors, and field distributions.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor</em> – Supriyo Datta
                    <br><small>I have tried to learn NEGF theory from this book. Although dated, I chose it for its simpler but precise explanations, many figures, and intuitive approach to describe transport properties.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur</em> – Lancaster & Blundell
                    <br><small>Started just to pass the time during a major power blackout when my phones were dead, I was deeply amazed at how such intricate concepts could be explained in a conversational narrative. Topics like propagators, statistical mechanics, Klein-Gordon equations, and cavity dynamics were the major parts I mostly covered.</small>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <section id="literatures">
            <h2>Scientific Literatures That Shaped My Thinking</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Jiang, Xue, et al. "Recent progress on 2D magnets: Fundamental mechanism, structural design and modification." Applied Physics Reviews 8.3 (2021).</em>, Phys. Rev. (2010)
                    <br><small>Helped me to understand the characterization of intrinsic magnetism and defect-induced magnetizations.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>De Bernardis, Daniele, Alberto Mercurio, and Simone De Liberato. "Tutorial on nonperturbative cavity quantum electrodynamics: is the Jaynes–Cummings model still relevant?." Journal of the Optical Society of America B 41.8 (2024): C206-C221.</em>
                    <br><small>Although currently I don't have sufficient expertise, this literature makes me very curious to study spin-photon coupling with QED-DFT based approach.</small>
