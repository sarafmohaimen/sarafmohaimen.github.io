            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Saraf Mohaimen Chowdhury, an early-career researcher passionate about quantum simulations, 2D materials, and nanoelectronic devices. My work blends first-principles theory with cutting-edge computational tools to explore spintronics, magnetism, and quantum transport at the nanoscale.</p>

                <li>B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering – [Port City International University], 2025</li>
                <li>Higher Secondary – [Pahartali College], 2019</li>

            <h2>Academic Books That Influenced Me</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Molecular Quantum Mechanics</em> – Atkins & Friedman  
                    <br><small>This text helped me build a foundational understanding of atomic-level interactions, their interpretations, and the conceptual basis of various approximation theories.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Semiconductor Physics and Devices</em> – Donald A. Neamen  
                    <br><small>Became familiar during my undergraduate studies, this text drew me toward crystallography, nonequilibrium behaviors, and field distributions.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor</em> – Supriyo Datta  
                    <br><small>I have tried to learn NEGF theory from this book. Although dated, I chose it for its simpler but precise explanations, many figures, and intuitive approach to describe transport properties.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur</em> – Lancaster & Blundell  
                    <br><small>Started just to pass the time during a major power blackout when my phones were dead, I was deeply amazed at how such intricate concepts could be explained in a conversational narrative. Topics like propagators, statistical mechanics, Klein-Gordon equations, and cavity dynamics were the major parts I mostly covered.</small>

            <h2>Scientific Literatures That Shaped My Thinking</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Jiang, Xue, et al. "Recent progress on 2D magnets: Fundamental mechanism, structural design and modification." Applied Physics Reviews 8.3 (2021).</em>, Phys. Rev. (2010)  
                    <br><small>Helped me to understand the characterization of intrinsic magnetism and defect-induced magnetizations.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Abdelsalam, Hazem, et al. "Magnetic and electronic properties of edge-modified triangular WS2 and MoS2 quantum dots." Crystals 13.2 (2023): 251.</em>, Science (2004)  
                    <br><small>Introduced me to how to deal with the non-periodic molecular systems.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>De Bernardis, Daniele, Alberto Mercurio, and Simone De Liberato. "Tutorial on nonperturbative cavity quantum electrodynamics: is the Jaynes–Cummings model still relevant?." Journal of the Optical Society of America B 41.8 (2024): C206-C221.</em>  
                    <br><small>Although currently I don't have sufficient expertise, this literature makes me very curious to study spin-photon coupling with QED-DFT based method.</small>
