            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Saraf Mohaimen Chowdhury, an early-career researcher passionate about quantum simulations, 2D materials, and nanoelectronic devices. My work blends first-principles theory with cutting-edge computational tools to explore spintronics, magnetism, and quantum transport at the nanoscale.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering – [Port City International University], 2025</li>
                <li>Higher Secondary – [Pahartali College], 2019</li>
                <li>Secondary – [Chittagong Model School and College], 2017</li>

            <h2>Academic Books That Influenced Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Molecular Quantum Mechanics</em> – Atkins & Friedman  
                    <br><small>This text helped me build a foundational understanding of atomic-level interactions, their interpretations, and the conceptual basis of various approximation theories.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Semiconductor Physics and Devices</em> – Donald A. Neamen  
                    <br><small>Became familiar during my undergraduate studies, this text drew me toward crystallography, nonequilibrium behaviors, and field distributions.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor</em> – Supriyo Datta  
                    <br><small>I have tried to learn NEGF theory from this book. Although dated, I chose it for its simpler but precise explanations, many figures, and intuitive approach to describe transport properties.</small>
                </li>
                <li><em>Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur</em> – Lancaster & Blundell  
                    <br><small>Started just to pass the time during a major power blackout when my phones were dead, I was deeply amazed at how such intricate concepts could be explained in a conversational narrative. Topics like propagators, statistical mechanics, Klein-Gordon equations, and cavity dynamics were the major parts I mostly covered.</small>

            <h2>Scientific Literatures That Shaped My Thinking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Novoselov et al., <em>Electric Field Effect in Atomically Thin Carbon Films</em>, Science (2004)  
                    <br><small>Introduced me to the fascinating world of graphene and 2D materials.</small>
                </li>
                <li>Zunger, <em>Practical DFT and Beyond</em>, Phys. Rev. (2010)  
                    <br><small>Helped me adopt DFT as a practical tool for predictive material science.</small>
                </li>
                <li>Datta, <em>Electronic Transport in Mesoscopic Systems</em>  
                    <br><small>Guided my understanding of quantum transport and NEGF formalism.</small>
